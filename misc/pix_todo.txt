[ ] turning off the music doesn't keep it turned off

[ ] -OOC- Justin93Daniels: Gotcha.  Did y'all also fix the Female Human Sprites?
-OOC- Justin93Daniels: There's an old typo in No Legs, No Left Arm.  It's worded "NoLegsNoLL", when it should be "NoLegsNoLA" or something like that.
-OOC- Justin93Daniels: Which means, should a female human have both legs and her left arm removed, she'd turn invisible.
